HDAdvisors (HDA) is a collaboration of experienced community development professionals launched in 2006. HDA provides housing-related consulting services to non-profits, housing authorities, local governments, lenders, and other community development organizations. HDA is led by [Erica Sims](./staff/erica.html), who has spent 20 years in affordable development as both a developer and consultant. 

HDA provides feasibility, financial and development consulting services for affordable housing and other community development projects. HDA is unique because its principals have spent decades as the heads of for-profit and non-profit development corporations and policy organizations in multiple states, building new construction and rehabilitation projects for affordable housing.  

This experience gives us an intimate knowledge of federal and local housing programs and what “works” and what does not. This development experience enables HDA to understand housing policy from the perspective of a practitioner in the private sector, to assist clients in creating projects that are workable in the real world.
