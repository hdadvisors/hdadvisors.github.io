## Eric Mai

#### Vice President

Eric has worked in the field of research for over a decade. Before entering the affordable housing industry, Eric worked as a field archaeologist in the Mid-Atlantic for six years. He received his Masters of Archaeology and Heritage Management from the University of Leicester and later his Masters in Urban and Regional Planning from Virginia Commonwealth University.Â 

His interdisciplinary background in art history, archaeology, and urban planning brings a distinctive perspective to affordable housing policy and research. Studying how communities throughout history designed and adapted their living spaces has given him unique insights into sustainable urban development and community-centered housing solutions. This historical lens enhances his approach to modern housing challenges, allowing me to identify time-tested patterns in how successful communities balance density, affordability, and quality of life.

Eric currently serves on nonprofit affordable housing boards, including RVA CDC and Commonwealth Catholic Charities Housing Corporation.
